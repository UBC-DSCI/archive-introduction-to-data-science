# Cleaning and wrangling data {#chapter4}

## Overview

This week will be centered around tools for cleaning and wrangling data. Again, this will be in the context of a real world Data Science application and we will continue to practice working through a whole case study.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the chapter, students will be able to:

* define the term "tidy data"
* discuss the advantages and disadvantages from storing data in a tidy data format
* recall and use the following tidyverse functions for their intended data wrangling tasks:
    - `select`
    - `filter`
    - `map`
    - `mutate`
    - `summarise`
    - `group_by`
    - `gather`

# Clustering {#chapter8}

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the chapter, students will be able to:

* Describe a case where clustering would be an appropriate tool, and what insight it would bring from the data.
* Explain the kmeans clustering algorithm.
* Interpret the output of a kmeans cluster analysis.

* Perform kmeans clustering in R using `kmeans`
* Visualize the output of kmeans clustering in R using pair-wise scatter plots

* Identify when it is necessary to scale variables before clustering and do this using R
* Use the elbow method to choose the number of clusters for k-means
* Describe advantages, limitations and assumptions of the kmeans clustering algorithm.

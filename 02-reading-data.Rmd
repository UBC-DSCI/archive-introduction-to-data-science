# Reading in data locally and from the web {#chapter3}

## Overview 

Learn to read in various cases of tabular data sets locally and from the web. Once read in, these data sets will be used to walk through a real world Data Science application that includes wrangling the data into a useable format and creating an effective data visualization.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the chapter, students will be able to:

* define the following:
    - absolute file path
    - relative file path
    - url
* match the following `tidyverse` `read_*` function arguments to their descriptions:
    - `file`
    - `delim`
    - `col_names`
    - `skip`
* choose the appropriate `tidyverse` `read_*` function and function arguments to load a given tabular data set into R
* use the `rvest` `html_nodes`, `html_text` and `html_attr` functions to scrape data from a `.html` file on the web
* compare downloading tabular data from a plain text file (e.g., `.csv`) from the web versus scraping data from a `.html` file

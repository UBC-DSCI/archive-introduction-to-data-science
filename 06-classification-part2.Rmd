# Classification, continued {#chapter7}

## Overview

Metrics for classification accuracy; cross-validation to choose the number of neighbours; scaling of variables and other practical considerations.

## Learning Objectives

* Describe what a test data set is and how it is used in classification.
* Using R, evaluate classification accuracy using a test data set and appropriate metrics.
* Using R, execute cross validation in R to choose the number of neighbours.
* Identify when it is necessary to scale variables before classification and do this using R
* In a dataset with > 2 attributes, perform k-nearest neighbour classification in R using caret::train(method = "knn", ...) to predict the class of a test dataset.
* Describe advantages and disadvantages of the k-nearest neighbour classification algorithm.

## Data set

Keep working with the Wisconsin Breast Cancer data set.
